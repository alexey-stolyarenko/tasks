                            The final scene of Horizon Zero Dawn reveals HADES has not
                            been completely defeated. A dark entity — thought to be
                            HADES — shoots out of a pile of rubble and is captured by Sylens,
                            a secondary character thought to be Aloy’s ally.

                            and seems ready to stop at nothing to acquire it. He could be the
                            main villain of Horizon Forbidden West or the catalyst for its
                            events at the very least.

                        Long time ago I received a series of professional
                        development coaching at work. The giving feedback
                        workshop was especially memorable, because it’s one
                        issue that I had been pondering for years.

                        And most importantly, my workshop is introvert
                        friendly. Instead of explaining while giving the
                        card to the person in front of you like in the card
                        game, we get to write down in silence and explain later! How?

                        It’s a game that gives you an insight into
                        your own personality and can be used to start
                        an in-depth conversation about each other’s
                        attitude and behavior.
                        The standard manual describes four ways to play the game, but you can
                        buy a more extensive manual, which offers 20 exercises.

                        The card deck consists of two types of cards:
                        strengths and weaknesses. Examples of strengths
                        are reliable, sensitive, honest, modest, creative,
                        or intelligent. Examples of weaknesses are moody,
                        prejudiced, selfish, rude, careless, or pessimistic.
