                                One of the Playstation’s biggest game expected to be released on the
                                PlayStation 5 in 2021 is Horizon Forbidden West, a sequel to Guerilla Games'
                                open-world sci-fi game from 2017. Sony Interactive Entertainment has continued
                                to pull back the curtain on the long-awaited sequel where Aloy's adventure continues.
                                This is everything that you'd want to know about the game, including its release window,
                                platforms, and story details.

                    nearly 1,000 ago as “peacemakers,” but need biomass for fuel. Eventually,
                    they consumed so much of the Earth’s biosphere that it eradicated most humans. But there was a Plan
